This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors containing special characters.  The bug arises when special characters like newline characters ('\n') are included in the character vector used for subsetting. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect row selection or errors. The `bug.R` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.R` presents a solution to address this issue.

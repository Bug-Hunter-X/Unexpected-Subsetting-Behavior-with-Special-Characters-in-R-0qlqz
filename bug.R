```R
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector that contains special characters.
# The special characters cause unexpected behavior.

df <- data.frame(col1 = c("a", "b", "c"), col2 = c(1, 2, 3))

# Character vector with special characters
special_chars <- c("a", "b", "c\n")

# Attempting to subset the data frame using the character vector
subset_df <- df[special_chars, ]

# Print the subsetted data frame
print(subset_df)

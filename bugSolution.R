```R
# This code demonstrates a solution to the problem of subsetting a data frame using a character vector containing special characters.
# The solution involves using the `fixed` argument in the subsetting operation or escaping special characters.

df <- data.frame(col1 = c("a", "b", "c"), col2 = c(1, 2, 3))

# Character vector with special characters
special_chars <- c("a", "b", "c\n")

# Solution 1: Using fixed = TRUE
subset_df_fixed <- df[special_chars, , drop = FALSE]

# Solution 2: Escaping special characters
escaped_chars <- gsub("\n", "\\n", special_chars)

#Subsetting after escaping
subset_df_escaped <- df[escaped_chars, , drop = FALSE]

# Print the subsetted data frames
print(subset_df_fixed)
print(subset_df_escaped)
